 Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

Objective:

Develop a web application that closely mimics the user interface and core functionalitiesof Google Sheets, with a focus on mathematical and data quality functions, data entry, and key UI interactions.

Features:

1. Spreadsheet Interface:
○ Mimic Google Sheets UI: Strive for a visual design and layout that
closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and
cell structure.
○ Drag Functions: Implement drag functionality for cell content, formulas,
and selections to mirror Google Sheets' behavior.
○ Cell Dependencies: Ensure that formulas and functions accurately reflect
cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to
related cells.
○ Support for basic cell formatting (bold, italics, font size, color).
○ Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

2. Mathematical Functions:
○ Implement the following mathematical functions:
1. SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
2. AVERAGE: Calculates the average of a range of cells.
3. MAX: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.
4. MIN: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.
5. COUNT: Counts the number of cells containing numerical values in a
range.

3. Data Quality Functions:
○ Implement the following data quality functions:
1. TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a cell.
2. UPPER: Converts the text in a cell to uppercase.
3. LOWER: Converts the text in a cell to lowercase.
4. REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.
5. FIND_AND_REPLACE: Allows users to find and replace specific text
within a range of cells.

4. Data Entry and Validation:
○ Allow users to input various data types (numbers, text, dates).
○ Implement basic data validation checks (e.g., ensuring numeric cells only contain numbers).

5. Testing:
○ Provide a means for users to test the implemented functions with their
own data.
○ Display the results of function execution clearly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus Features:
● Implement additional mathematical and data quality functions.
● Add support for more complex formulas and cell referencing (e.g., relative and absolute references).
● Allow users to save and load their spreadsheets.
● Incorporate data visualization capabilities (e.g., charts, graphs).
Evaluation Criteria:
● Fidelity to Google Sheets UI: How closely the application's look and feel matches Google Sheets, including drag functions and cell dependency handling.
● Functionality and completeness of the implemented features.
● Accuracy of the mathematical and data quality functions.
● Usability and intuitiveness of the user interface.
● Code quality and maintainability.
● Implementation of bonus features.
● Readme should give a clear explanation of Datastructures and tech stack used and why so.
